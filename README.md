This repo holds an end-of-semester project for a data analytics course. 

The goal of the project was to create a predictive data model in order to proactively identify a university's season ticket holders for an athletic team that were planning to discontinue their season ticket subscription. 

Data cleaning and organizing was done on a sample set of data that was supplied for the project. After data cleaning was completed, a predictive model was created, then results of the model were displayed in several different visuals in order to identify correlations between certain variables in the data set. Lastly, a summary of the findings and takeaways was compiled.
